Commands:
      
      new n    -     Creates a new nxn grid and opens a 500x500 window

      init     -     Enters initialization mode
                     Takes sets of two numbers x and y and turns that cell on
                     Stops when -1 -1 is read
                        Ex: init 0 0 1 1 2 2 -1 -1
                            Turns on cells (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) and exits initialization mode

      print    -     Prints the current grid in the terminal window

      step     -     Runs one tick of the grid
                     Updates the graphical window

      steps n  -     Runs n ticks of the graphical window

      random n -     Randomly turns n% of the grid on and (100-n)% off

      auto n   -     Automatically steps every n milliseconds
                     Will run infinitely. Only way to stop is to Ctrl-c or end the process


To compile and run: 
      $ make
      $ ./life-graphical

Common running procedure:
      ./life-graphical
         new n
         random n
         auto n


This program leaks memory due to the implementation of the Xwindow class
